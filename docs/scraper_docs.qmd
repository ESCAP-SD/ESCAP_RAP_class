# Requirements for the RAP

Based on common guides such as [Practical guidelines on web scraping for the HICP (2020)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/272892/12032198/Guidelines-web-scraping-HICP-11-2020.pdf/), we know that the RAP must satisfy a few requirements:

-   identify the user-agent as being from an NSI
-   sufficient pause (for example 1 second) between requests so that servers are not overloaded
-   scrapers are run at nigh time or off peak hours (unless there are day time price dynamics that are different from night time ones that we want to capture).
-   respect the robots exclusion protocol on the website

This page thus documents the RAP that is demoed to learners.
