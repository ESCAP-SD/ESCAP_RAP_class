# Overview

Unlike the first class that aimed to introduce RAP and why it was relevant, the purposes of this class is to show in more detail what each principle is, plus some practical examples of how to apply this. Or in other words - show *How to RAP*. This page thus has the slides that are used in the in-person training, as well as examples to refer to

# Practical content

To support the in-person training, below we list out the supporting material that learners can refer to. It outlines each of the principles in high level, and some in more detail where technical examples are valuable. See the [NHS site on RAP for more details](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/#rap-principles) on each principle.

## Practical content, first set {#practical-set-one}

### Principle 1: Automation

As the fundamental principles of RAP is to make the process of (in our case) making official statistics reproducible, we should do our utmost to eliminate manual human steps (unless they are explicitly needed off course!). Thus we want to create a script that automates the whole process and creates a very neat handoff of a *tidy data* file as output. A key aspect here is [mapping the process](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/implementing_RAP/process_mapping/) so that your script can operate in a way as to minimize human actions.

In our case, we've seen this with the [overall process of the price statistics pipeline with web scraped data](../../applying_rap/process-mapping.qmd), as well as the [specific step that maps the process of web scraping](../../scraper_docs/mapping_the_process.qmd).

We'll see some practical steps below (once we've covered modular coding) on how that could work in practice.

### Principle 2: Modular, re-usable

Modularity and coupling are two very critical aspects and we should spend time discussing them in detail. They actually are conceptually quite related and for simplicity (in this course), we can consider them as trying to achieve the same thing. These are also both far from a RAP (or even official statistics concept) as they are widely discussed in the wider software engineering and even software architecture! This should not discourage us though - as knowing these is also important for us for two aspects:

-   It helps us write better code when we are developing pipelines, and
-   It also helps us design more dynamic overall processes of how we build operational flows with alternative data.

So what is the concept?

![tight vs loose coupling](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/images/tight-loose-coupling.png){width="500"}

If we write everything all in one long and big script - it is likely that some small thing will break the script and we will have to spend a long time figuring out what is wrong and fixing it. However, if we isolate specific logical steps into functions and then put them together - if something happens, then we will quickly be able to isolate it to the affected function and fix that function. Each function is thus meant to do just one thing - but it does that one thing very well!

We should thus aim to develop loosely coupled software.

Furthermore, we can also apply this thinking to bigger processes as we saw when we mapped the [overall process of the price statistics pipeline with web scraped data](../../applying_rap/process-mapping.qmd) - we broke out the overall process into several steps - in essence separate pipelines.

### What does this mean if we put it together?

Lets see what this means by focusing on the [example provided by the NHS](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/implementing_RAP/process_mapping/#using-a-process-map-to-find-improvements) - what could this look like in code?

Remember the demo from the RAP guide:

```{mermaid}
graph LR

    A[Load CSV] --> B[(Database)];
    H[/CSV 1/] --> A
    I[/CSV 2/] --> A
    D[Calculate todays date] --> E[[Run SQL Script]]
    K[Get todays date manual/config]:::manual --> E
    J{Is todays date provided?} -->|no| D
    J -->|yes| K
    B --> E
    E --> F[Generate Excel output]
    F --> G[/Excel Output/]

    classDef manual fill:#FFCCCC
```

Let's see what general functions could be created

``` python
def load_csv():
    # do something to load the csv and convert it to a clean dataframe
    return dataframe

def load_database(dataframe):
    # load the data in the dataframe into the database

def output_date_for_processing(optional_date_input):
    # check if the input data is provided, if not, calculate it
    return todays_date

def run_sql_script(todays_date):
    # Run the SQL script that we need to run
    return dataframe_output

def save_excel_output(dataframe, location_to_save_output):
    # Save the output in the location we want
```

Now we can figure out how to automate this. A very simple way when you are starting out is to make one `main()` function that calls other functions, and then give inputs to that function for it to operate properly:

``` python
def main(csv_to_load_into_the_database, date, location_to_save_output):
    # main function that operationalizes everything

    # Step 1:
    # load the csv
    dataframe = load_csv(csv_to_load_into_the_database)
    # save the data into the databse
    load_database(dataframe)

    # Step 2:
    # check date
    date_to_use = output_date_for_processing(date)
    # send this to SQL script
    dataframe_from_sql = run_sql_script(date_to_use)
    # save this output
    save_excel_output(dataframe_from_sql)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
csv1 = "C:/some/file/path/file.csv"
todays_date = '2024-09-18'
location_to_save = "C:/some/other/path"
# lets call the main function

main(csv1, todays_date, location_to_save)
```

That's it! Check out a [helpful article by the NHS on functional programming for a slighly deper dive](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/python-functions/).

### Exercise 1

Ready to try this yourself? Look at a notebook that you developed for this course - and see how to separate out what you did into functions. Talk to the mentors in the room if you have questions!

### Principle 3: Transparency

Working in a transparent manner (even if in your NSO this will apply to a more internal audience rather than publicly), is very useful as it helps develops skills and a way of working that results in better code and hence easier (and more reproducible) processes. This principle actually links quite heavily with several other principles such as:

-   use of a git based version control software to store an authoritative version of the code and all related aspects (this does not have to be GitHub, GitLab for example is also very popular);
-   using open-source tools (principle 4)
-   adopting good development practices (which includes good coding practices and also documentation of how the code works) (principle 6)
-   and others!

While at a glance, this principle seems to be repeated in other principles - however transparency stands as a principle on its own. Adopting all other principles but still working in a non-transparent manner will naturally result in lower trust (as noone will know how the specific process works), lower levels of collaboration (and thus higher likelihood that mistakes or improvements will be identified), and a very strong likelihood of isolation from consistent standards others have adopted. Thus working in a transparent manner (as much as possible in your NSO) is very useful and helps push the pipeline to be even more mature and reproducible!

### Principle 4: Use of open-source tools

As RAP fundamentally is about reproducibility and technical maturity - both aspects are most effectively enabled if open-source tools are used. Open-source tools (like python or R) are incredibly popular around the world - hence there is lots of training on the topic, ChatGPT will give you a good response for specific problems, and its more likely that your colleagues can learn it (or have already) and can help you develop the pipeline or peer review it!

As an aside - several organizations (for example see [IEEE specturm](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024) and [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/)) rate the top programming languages around the world and Python (R less so but still a bit) usually are rated highly. The challenge with these surveys is they assess or survey all developers - and some developers need to focus on back-end (SQL or Java) or web development (hence JavaScript) - which can seem misleading. A good takeaway is that for dynamic and simple languages for data analysis and processing - Python and R are very popular - which helps when you are developing your pipeline!

### Principle 5: Version control

RAPs (and code that helps create official statistics) if fundamentally well developed open-sources software. Hence we need to adopt tools that help us manage all the aspects of its lifecycle - and `git` based version control with a site like GitHub or GitLab is the most popular way to help develop and operates software. As a summary it allows you to:

-   version control all your code and documents (and data too for non-confidential data) - thus you never have to know which is the final one or which was used when in the past!
    -   have a look at the [commits to the `main` branch of this repo](https://github.com/sergegoussev/ESCAP_RAP_class/commits/main/)!
-   furthemore, from a development point of view, you can also create targeted releases for stable versions and see what the release was at that time - making it very easy to know what version of the pipeline was used historically!
    -   have a look at the [releases for the python `pandas` library](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/releases), very popular with data analysis package!
-   create different code bases (as braches) off the main one that allow you to collaborate with others or develop/fix parts simultaneously, as well as join them all together when appropriate;
    -   for example, have a look at a [pull request (a request to merge one branch into the main branch) that we collaborated on for this class](https://github.com/sergegoussev/ESCAP_RAP_class/pull/12) - where you can have one individual review the change and approve it prior to the change happening!
-   project manage all the aspects of the work by creating issues (for each task or bug), milestones (for phases or categories of the work).
    -   check out the [GitHub project we used to coordinate the development of materials](https://github.com/users/sergegoussev/projects/3/views/1?layout=table) for this class!
-   automate testing and deployment of your package or its related aspects automatically (an advanced feature but quite useful).
    -   for example [have a look at how we enabled GitHub to update this class website automatically and deploy a new version every time we make changes to the `main` branch](https://github.com/sergegoussev/ESCAP_RAP_class/actions)
-   and many more!

We covered git and GitHub/Lab in detail in the slides (above), however for more details, feel free to check out the [NHS intro to Git](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/introduction-to-git/) for more details.

### Exercise 2 (on your own)

Ready to try this yourself? Let's try to create a very simple GitHub repository. To walkthrough this excersize, you need to [have `git` installed on your computer](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [you need a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github). Do these steps first if you don't already have this.

There are several exercises we recommend you try at your own pace. As these may take some time, this can be done in the afternoon:

1.  GitHub has a very very simple Hello World example - <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world>. Follow that to create a repository!
2.  As the above example did not have a copy of the code locally, a slightly more involved walkthrough is available from the [NHS RAP community of practice on committing work to a remote repository](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/committing_work_walkthrough/).
3.  The NHS RAP Community of Practice also has a walkthrough on [how to work with branches](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/working_with_branches_walkthrough/);
4.  Finally, this guide on [Pull and Merge requests by the NHS RAP Community of Practice](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/pull_and_merge_requests_walkthrough/) will help cement what you've practiced in the 3 other walkthroughs above!
