## Context

As part of the Big Data Project, over the summer of 2024, ESCAP has been providing capacity support to project countries that have indicated web scraping for price statistics as a priority – by providing training on web scraping. Check out the [rich training website](https://xtophe.notion.site/Web-Scraping-for-CPI-Training-c36b27c2ea6b4f02ad760069afaf6fb5) for more details about the training in general, watch videos of past sessions, and review the materials.

A key topic of this training is Reproducible Analytical Pipelines or RAP. RAP was originally developed in the United Kingdom government to improve the processes that government teams use to make their outputs more reproducible, as well as speed up their production processes. RAP can be thought of as an approach to working which brings together a range of open source tools, techniques from fields like reproducible research, software engineering, and DevOps to make statistical releases easily reproducible, testable, and auditable (check out the [original article from 2017](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) explaining the concept and the purpose). Given that its a framework for mature processes, it can also be applied to the critical aspect of web scraping or related steps in making official statistics with this data – as data collection and preparation for the CPI should be robust and highly reproducible!

The purpose of this course is thus to teach RAP to project countries and help them apply the concept to web scraping specifically, but also help them practice the techniques and tools so that RAP can be applied to other pipelines to produce the CPI or other official statistics.

## How the site can help you (i.e. navigation guide)

This site is used to structure and store the RAP training materials. This content can thus help learners during the session and also be available after the training as a reference. The site thus:

-   Summarizes how the training is structured and provide copies of the training materials:
    -   The main [overview page provides a summary of what is covered](teaching_materials/teaching.qmd) in each session;
    -   The detailed pages for the [September 11, 2024 session](teaching_materials/sept_11/sept_11_session.qmd) and the [September 18, 2024 session](teaching_materials/sept_18/sept_18_session.qmd) provide the slides and supporting information from each of the training sessions.
-   Provides [visual overview (via a process map)](applying_rap/index.qmd) of the whole process from scraping a site to the elementary aggregates that are included into the CPI so that learners can see how to apply RAP. It also contains a closeup of the web scraping process.
-   Includes code and visual demonstrations of how RAP principles can be applied to enhance the web scraping process. Specifically:
    -   A notebook showing an exploration scraper on the training [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/index.html) site
    -   It also shows [how to map the process for this exploratory scraper](applying_rap/mapping_the_process.qmd) and begin to make it more RAP friendly, as well as examples of some more modular code that learners can start with.

## Other useful reading

This site (and the training) does not aim to be comprehensive but simply demonstrate and document the key concepts so that learners have enough to do their own training. For more on RAP, we encourage you to check out:

-   The [NHS RAP Communitity of Practice](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/) – that contains lots more useful content on a large number of RAP concepts
-   The [RAP Companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/) - which provides a good guide for each component (although focuses on R)
-   The [Udemy class on *Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) using R*](https://www.udemy.com/course/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/)- provides a good overview of RAP with R
-   A [presentation](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/7.4%20United%20Kingdom_0.pdf) and a [paper](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/7.4%20UK_un_systems_railfares_paper.pdf) providing a good guide of the application of RAP to price statistics, specifically for rail fares
