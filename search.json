    "text": "Overview of the ADS processing view\nWeb scraping is the first of several phases necessary to create elementary aggregates –- which are the main input and the building blocks of the Consumer Prices Index. The below sections first provide an overview of the key step and options of how RAP cap apply to the overall process, then go through each step in order to gather detailed requirements for the web scraping step.\n\nOverview of all the steps\nThe below diagram provides an overview of 4 main steps that include the web scraping step, data processing or preparation step, the classification step, and the price index or aggregation step. Each step outputs a dataset that is used as an input for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: High level overview of the steps to process web scrape data for the CPI\n\n\n\nEach step is made up of one or more sub-components:\n\nThe web scraping step contains the scraping aspect itself,1 but also includes dataset validation that will help make sure that the scraper is operating as it is expected, as well as reports for review;2\nThe data processing step contains the process to standardizing and preparation step.3\nThe classification step contains several sub-steps, such as identifying unique products to classify, the classification method itself, and the manual validation of classification (in cases there are errors).4\nFor the price index step, many sub-steps are involved.5\n\n\n\nHow does RAP come into this?\nGiven this context, RAP can be applied in several ways. As RAP is a way to encapsulate the creation of a statistical (in our case) process into one corpus (i.e. repository with all contexts) – we can:\n\nEncapsulate the whole process in one repository. As RAP is meant to help minimize coupling (dependencies) between separate processes – treating the whole process end-to-end as one RAP is useful if no steps in this pipeline have to be shared with other pipelines.\nEncapsulate each step into a separate RAP. This may be appropriate if several processing phases are done in sequence with specific targeted stopping points – such as handoff between teams or if some steps are shared or where manual steps are necessary. The UK RAP implementation shows how several pipelines operate on top of a data architecture in sequence.6\nEncapsulate as appropriate. Several steps could be combined to simplify the process and if separation is not required, such as the web scraping and data processing steps.\n\nFor this guide and for the demo RAP scraper, we will follow approach (b) as this will allow us to develop RAP for just the scraping component.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis pages provides an overview of the course, but the actual material is still being finalized\n\n\nReproducible Analytic Pipelines (or RAP) is taught by UN ESCAP in two sessions. This training includes several components\n\nOverall scope of the training\nRAP is a large topic and it has its own Udemy course, supporting sites (such as the RAP companion), as well as communities of practice. ESCAP can’t thus hope to cover it in full, but instead aims to provide a detailed enough overview so that member countries being trained on web scraping for the CPI can benefit from maturity principles that RAP represents.\nOverall objective\nThe overall objective of the RAP training is to provide an overview of key RAP principles, cover the value it brings to official statistics, as well as train class participants up to figure out just enough so that they can proceed on their own and help bring in RAP it into their own work. Class participants (who ESCAP trains) can thus become trainers in their own National Statistical Organizations (NSOs) - helping their teams and groups continue to learn more about RAP, explore each of the best practices, and learn how to implement it into their research or official statistics (i.e. production). In a more formal sense, this RAP class is thus aims to increase the capacity of participating NSOs to learn RAP and apply it for their continued modernization, and especially the implementation of alternative (web scrape most notably) data for consumer price statistics. Two sessions provide fist an overview and second a deeper dive on RAP\n\n\nSession 1, virtual: Overview of RAP\nDate: September 11, 2024\nObjective: Introduce ideas inherent in RAP and have participants walk away with an understanding why technical maturity skills are important and how RAP can help them mature their organization\nTopics to cover:\n\nWhy RAP is important to learn\nWhat is RAP in more detail and what problem is it aiming to solve\nOutline of key RAP principles and how they would help\nDiscussion on maturity levels - to show that its not all or nothing\nVery brief demo of a use case to demonstrate something and walk away from the more theoretical ideas\nSome caveats to keep in mind and wrap up for what you will see in person!\n\nContent: See the session page for more details.\n\n\nSession 2, in person: Deeper dive into RAP components\nDate: September 18, 2024\nObjective: Building on the initial training on RAP, go deeper into the components to really get the principles across. To help anchor the components, a use case can be used to understand how a little bit more about each aspect, and some hands-on exercises will help learners get a better appreciation of the tasks.\nTopics to cover:\n\nQuick overview to recap the previous session\nDeeper coverage of principles - weaving the use case into each component:\n\nAutomation\nModularity, re-usability, etc\nTransparency\nOpen source tools\nVersion control\nGood coding practices\nTesting\nPeer review\n\nExercise\n\nExercise in detail: To help anchor several of the technical skills in RAP, participants should spend about an hour in person (helped by the mentors who are there in person) try one (or two?) of a set of possible topics. Specifically, depending on their programming skills, access to a computer with Python, or knowledge of the overall process, participants can pick from several topics to spend an hour trying to implement. Possible topics (TBC):\n\nDetailed mapping of the web scraping process - sketch out how your country’s specific web scraping needs to to be automated. Plan out the components and sub-components of the process to practice design and planning ahead of coding.\nTry functional programming! This is key about learning technical skills to make your code more modular and efficient and is the next step to help organize code together!\nTry creating .py scripts, making your code more robust for production and the next step from exploration!\nTry git and peer review - first develop a notebook (or script) to do some scraping. Then commit it to a github repository and then ask someone to peer review it using a separate branch (and a pull request) or simply an issue - to create transparency.\n\nFor all examples, some experience in python and setup of git with a github account is needed\nContent: See the session page for more details.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
