Check out the rich training website for more details about the training in general, watch videos of past sessions, and review the materials.\nA key topic of this training is Reproducible Analytical Pipelines or RAP. RAP was originally developed in the United Kingdom government to improve the processes that government teams use to make their outputs more reproducible, as well as speed up their production processes. RAP is really a framework – that brings together a range of open source tools, techniques from fields like reproducible research, software engineering, and DevOps to make statistical releases easily reproducible, testable, and auditable (check out the original article from 2017explaining the concept and the purpose). Given that its a framework for mature processes, it can also be applied to the critical aspect of web scraping – as data collection and preparation for the CPI should be robust and highly reproducible!\nThe purpose of this course is thus to teach RAP to project countries and help them apply the concept to web scraping, but also help them practice the techniques and tools so that RAP can be applied to other pipelines to produce the CPI or other official statistics.\n\n\n\nThis site is used to structure and store the RAP training materials. Specifically, it aims to:\n\nSummarize how the training is structured and provide copies of the training slides\n\nCheck out the training scope;\nAs well as the slides for the September 11, 2024 session, as well as the September 18, 2024 session\n\nIt contains an example pipeline to scrape a website and create an output data file. This example acts as a demonstration of a production piece of software to demonstrate how jupyter notebooks that were heavily demonstrated in the virtual training are transformed into a more mature process that can be run regularly to support the CPI:\n\nThe site thus demonstrates various RAP principles in action in a simple way. This documentation is thus meant to show the key concept, but not necessarily be comprehensive.\nThe site also stores the code to operate the scraping RAP and documents its operational aspects\n\nThe site also provides a visual overview (via a process map) how a web scraper pipeline such as the one demonstrated can be integrated into other aspects of the CPI production process, commenting on how RAP can be applied to other aspects.\n\n\n\n\nThis site (and the training) does not aim to be comprehensive but simply demonstrate and document the key concepts. For more on RAP, we encourage you to check out:\n\nThe NHS RAP Communitity of Practice – that contains lots more useful content\nThe RAP Companion - which provides a good guide for each component (although focuses on R);\nThe Udemy class on Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) using R- provides a good overview\nA presentation and a paper providing a good guide of the application of RAP to price statistics, specifically for rail fares\nand many more!"
