Check out the rich training website for more details about the training in general, watch videos of past sessions, and review the materials.\nA key topic of this training is Reproducible Analytical Pipelines or RAP. RAP was originally developed in the United Kingdom government to improve the processes that government teams use to make their outputs more reproducible, as well as speed up their production processes. RAP is really a framework – that brings together a range of open source tools, techniques from fields like reproducible research, software engineering, and DevOps to make statistical releases easily reproducible, testable, and auditable (check out the original article from 2017explaining the concept and the purpose). Given that its a framework for mature processes, it can also be applied to the critical aspect of web scraping – as data collection and preparation for the CPI should be robust and highly reproducible!\nThe purpose of this course is thus to teach RAP to project countries and help them apply the concept to web scraping, but also help them practice the techniques and tools so that RAP can be applied to other pipelines to produce the CPI or other official statistics.\n\n\n\nThis site is used to structure and store the RAP training materials. Specifically, it aims to:\n\nSummarize how the training is structured and provide copies of the training slides\n\nCheck out the training scope;\nAs well as the slides for the September 11, 2024 session, as well as the September 18, 2024 session\n\nIt contains an example pipeline to scrape a website and create an output data file. This example acts as a demonstration of a production piece of software to demonstrate how jupyter notebooks that were heavily demonstrated in the virtual training are transformed into a more mature process that can be run regularly to support the CPI:\n\nThe site thus demonstrates various RAP principles in action in a simple way. This documentation is thus meant to show the key concept, but not necessarily be comprehensive.\nThe site also stores the code to operate the scraping RAP and documents its operational aspects\n\nThe site also provides a visual overview (via a process map) how a web scraper pipeline such as the one demonstrated can be integrated into other aspects of the CPI production process, commenting on how RAP can be applied to other aspects.\n\n\n\n\nThis site (and the training) does not aim to be comprehensive but simply demonstrate and document the key concepts.

The below diagram provides an overview of 4 main steps that include the web scraping step, data processing or preparation step, the classification step, and the price index or aggregation step. Each step outputs a dataset that is used as an input for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: High level overview of the steps to process web scrape data for the CPI\n\n\n\nEach step is made up of one or more sub-components:\n\nThe web scraping step contains the scraping aspect itself,1 but also includes dataset validation that will help make sure that the scraper is operating as it is expected, as well as reports for review;2\nThe data processing step contains the process to standardizing and preparation step.3\nThe classification step contains several sub-steps, such as identifying unique products to classify, the classification method itself, and the manual validation of classification (in cases there are errors).4\nFor the price index step, many sub-steps are involved.5\n\n\n\nGiven this context, RAP can be applied in several ways. As RAP is a way to encapsulate the creation of a statistial (in our case) process into one corpus (i.e. repository with all contexts) – we can:\n\nEncapsulate the whole process in one repository. As RAP is meant to help minimize coupling (dependencies) between separate processes – treating the whole process end-to-end as one RAP is useful if no steps in this pipeline have to be shared with other pipelines.\nEncapsulate each step into a separate RAP. This may be appropriate if several processing phases are done on the data and other steps (such as manual ones) are necessary. The UK RAP implementation shows how several pipelines operate on top of a data architecture.6\nEncapsulate as appropriate. Several steps could be combined to simplify the process and if separation is not required, such as the web scraping and data processing steps.\n\nFor this guide and for the demo RAP scraper, we will follow approach (b) by developing a RAP for just the scraping step.\n\n\n\n\nIt is useful to know a bit more about each process to better understand how RAP can be applied for each step.",

Each step outputs a dataset that is used as an input for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: High level overview of the steps to process web scrape data for the CPI\n\n\n\nEach step is made up of one or more sub-components:\n\nThe web scraping step contains the scraping aspect itself,1 but also includes dataset validation that will help make sure that the scraper is operating as it is expected, as well as reports for review;2\nThe data processing step contains the process to standardizing and preparation step.3\nThe classification step contains several sub-steps, such as identifying unique products to classify, the classification method itself, and the manual validation of classification (in cases there are errors).4\nFor the price index step, many sub-steps are involved.5\n\n\n\nGiven this context, RAP can be applied in several ways. As RAP is a way to encapsulate the creation of a statistial (in our case) process into one corpus (i.e. repository with all contexts) – we can:\n\nEncapsulate the whole process in one repository. As RAP is meant to help minimize coupling (dependencies) between separate processes – treating the whole process end-to-end as one RAP is useful if no steps in this pipeline have to be shared with other pipelines.\nEncapsulate each step into a separate RAP. This may be appropriate if several processing phases are done on the data and other steps (such as manual ones) are necessary. The UK RAP implementation shows how several pipelines operate on top of a data architecture.6\nEncapsulate as appropriate. Several steps could be combined to simplify the process and if separation is not required, such as the web scraping and data processing steps.\n\nFor this guide and for the demo RAP scraper, we will follow approach (b) by developing a RAP for just the scraping step.",

This training includes several components\n\n\nRAP is a large topic and it has its own Udemy course, supporting sites (such as the RAP companion), as well as communities of practice. ESCAP can’t thus hope to cover it in full, but instead aims to provide a detailed enough overview so that member countries being trained on web scraping for the CPI can benefit from maturity principles that RAP represents.\n\n\nThe overall objective of the RAP training is to provide an overview of key RAP principles, cover the value it brings to official statistics, as well as train class participants up to figure out just enough so that they can proceed on their own and help bring in RAP it into their own work. Class participants (who ESCAP trains) can thus become trainers in their own National Statistical Organizations (NSOs) - helping their teams and groups continue to learn more about RAP, explore each of the best practices, and learn how to implement it into their research or official statistics (i.e. production). In a more formal sense, this RAP class is thus aims to increase the capacity of participating NSOs to learn RAP and apply it for their continued modernization, and especially the implementation of alternative (web scrape most notably) data for consumer price statistics.

Specifically, depending on their programming skills, access to a computer with Python, or knowledge of the overall process, participants can pick from several topics to spend an hour trying to implement. Possible topics:\n\nDetailed mapping of the web scraping process - sketch out how your country’s specific web scraping needs to to be automated. Plan out the components and sub-components of the process to practice design and planning ahead of coding.\nDevelop unit tests - write a few scenarios for a specific task that would be a clearly encapsulated single function in the code. Then develop test data and create a unit test for this task\nPartner up and try peer review - first develop a notebook (or script) to do some scraping. Then commit it to a github repository and then ask someone to peer review it using a separate branch (and a pull request) or simply an issue - to create transparency.\n\nFor all examples, some experience in python and setup of git with a github account is needed",
